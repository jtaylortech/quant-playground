# Quant Finance Playground - Development Roadmap

## üìå Phase 1: Planning & Research
### **1. Define Core Requirements**
- Finalize the list of core features (code execution, backtesting, visualization, etc.).
- Identify must-have vs. nice-to-have features.
- Research similar platforms (Replit, CodePen, QuantConnect) for inspiration and differentiation.
- Define user personas (students, aspiring quants, professionals pivoting into quant).

### **2. Technology Stack Selection**
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js for SSR), TypeScript, Monaco Editor (VS Code core).
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, Redis (for caching executions).
- **Execution Engine:** Docker containers, Kubernetes for scalability.
- **Data Pipelines:** Apache Airflow, AWS S3 for dataset storage.
- **Hosting:** AWS/GCP/Azure (to be decided based on costs & scalability needs).
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or Auth0 for seamless login.

---

## üöÄ Phase 2: MVP Development
### **1. Initial Setup**
- Deploy a basic Next.js frontend with FastAPI backend.
- Implement authentication (Google, GitHub login).
- Set up a PostgreSQL database schema for user profiles, code history, and saved models.

### **2. Code Execution Environment**
- Create a lightweight execution sandbox using Docker containers.
- Implement a queueing system (Redis + Celery) to handle multiple execution requests.
- Auto-install missing Python packages when required (mimicking Replit's behavior).
- Implement a Python kernel (supporting Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, etc.).
- Set up logging and error handling for execution failures.

### **3. Data Integration**
- Provide seamless integration with Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Quandl APIs.
- Set up data pipelines to fetch and cache financial data.
- Create database tables for storing user-uploaded datasets.

### **4. Basic Frontend UI**
- Code editor with syntax highlighting, auto-complete.
- Console output window for execution results.
- Simple UI for fetching and displaying financial data.

## üìà Phase 3: Advanced Features
### **1. Backtesting Engine**
- Integrate `Backtrader` or `Zipline` for backtesting capabilities.
- Provide sample strategies (Mean Reversion, Momentum, Pairs Trading).
- Allow users to visualize strategy performance metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Drawdowns, etc.).

### **2. Advanced Visualization Tools**
- Implement interactive charts with Plotly/Bokeh.
- Allow users to generate and export strategy reports (PDF/HTML).
- Provide pre-built templates for common quant models (Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, CAPM).

### **3. Cloud Execution & Scalability**
- Implement Kubernetes-based job execution for handling large workloads.
- Enable parallel computing for Monte Carlo simulations and ML models.
- Introduce GPU-based computation support for deep learning models.

### **4. Collaboration & Community**
- Enable real-time collaboration like Google Docs (Socket.io/WebSockets).
- Allow users to fork and share strategies.
- Implement a leaderboard system for quant challenges.

## üèÜ Phase 4: Monetization & Growth
### **1. Premium Features**
- Introduce paid tiers for power users (longer execution times, premium datasets, cloud storage).
- Offer API keys for premium data integrations (Bloomberg, Refinitiv).
- Provide one-click deployment to cloud trading environments.

### **2. AI-Powered Quant Tools**
- Integrate AI/ML models for automated strategy optimization.
- Offer AI-assisted coding suggestions (e.g., "Generate a momentum-based strategy").
- Provide sentiment analysis on financial news and social media feeds.

### **3. Marketing & Expansion**
- Launch a beta program with select users.
- Partner with universities and finance programs.
- Organize coding challenges and competitions.
