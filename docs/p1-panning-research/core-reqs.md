### **1. Define Core Requirements**

Defining core requirements is crucial to ensure the platform is built with a clear vision and practical execution strategy. This section lays the foundation for the key features, user needs, and technical considerations.

#### **1.1 Core Features**
The Quant Finance Playground must include the following fundamental features:
- **Code Execution Environment**: Support for Python, R, and Julia with pre-installed finance-related libraries like `QuantLib`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `Backtrader`, and `TA-Lib`.
- **Backtesting & Simulation**: Provide users with the ability to backtest trading strategies using historical and real-time data.
- **Data Integration**: Seamless integration with free and premium data sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Quandl, Bloomberg, etc.).
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Interactive financial charts, correlation matrices, and automated report generation (PDF/HTML) with performance metrics.
- **Interview & Practice Mode**: A structured environment with coding challenges and mock quant finance assessments.
- **Collaboration & Sharing**: Enable users to fork strategies, collaborate in real-time, and compete on leaderboards.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: AI-powered model recommendations, sentiment analysis, and automated strategy optimization.

#### **1.2 Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have Features**
| Feature                  | Priority |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Code Execution Engine   | Must-Have |
| Backtesting Framework   | Must-Have |
| Data Integration        | Must-Have |
| Visualization Tools     | Must-Have |
| Interview Prep & Challenges | Must-Have |
| AI-Powered Strategy Optimization | Nice-to-Have |
| Community Challenges    | Nice-to-Have |
| Cloud Deployment for Live Trading | Nice-to-Have |

#### **1.3 Competitor Research & Differentiation**
- **Replit & CodePen**: Provide general coding sandboxes but lack quant-focused integrations.
- **QuantConnect**: Great for algorithmic trading but has a steep learning curve and paid limitations.
- **Google Colab/Jupyter**: Powerful environments but require manual setup and lack real-time collaboration.
- **Unique Differentiators for Our Platform**:
  - Zero-setup quant environment with auto-installed dependencies.
  - Seamless integration of trading APIs and live market data.
  - Beginner-friendly templates for portfolio optimization, option pricing, and Monte Carlo simulations.
  - AI-powered strategy generation and analysis.

#### **1.4 System Performance Expectations**
- **Execution Speed**: Fast response time for code execution (target <1s for basic scripts, <5s for backtesting).
- Local Execution: Instead of providing built-in compute resources, allow users to run heavy tasks on their own machines (with setup guides).
<!---
- **Resource Consumption**: Efficient use of cloud infrastructure to handle concurrent executions without unnecessary costs. (NO FUNDING FOR NOW)
- Deferred GPU Support: GPU-based tasks (Monte Carlo, ML) will be delayed until a revenue model supports cloud costs. (NO FUNDING FOR NOW)
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale compute resources dynamically based on user demand. (NO FUNDING FOR NOW)

#### **1.5 Security & Privacy Considerations**
- **User Data Protection**: Store user scripts and datasets securely with encryption.
- **API Key Management**: Implement a secure vault for users to store API credentials for premium data providers.
- **Access Control**: Ensure proper authentication and role-based permissions for sharing projects.

#### **1.6 User Personas**
Persona	|Goals   |Pain Points|
|-------|--------|-------------|
Students	| Learn quant finance concepts and apply them in a practical setting.	| Lack of access to real-world datasets and tools.
Aspiring Quants	| Build a portfolio of strategies and prepare for interviews.	| Steep learning curve for backtesting and optimization.
Professionals	| Pivot into quant finance or sharpen existing skills.	| Limited time to set up and manage local environments.
Hobbyists	| Experiment with trading strategies in their free time.	| Difficulty accessing premium data and compute resources.
